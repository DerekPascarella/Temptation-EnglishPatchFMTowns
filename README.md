<h1>Temptation</h1>
<img width="165" height="228" align="right" src="https://github.com/DerekPascarella/Temptation-EnglishPatchFMTowns/blob/main/images/cover_front.jpg?raw=true">English translation patch for eroge fighting game "Temptation" on the FM Towns/FM Towns Marty.
<br><br>
Temptation puts the player in the shoes of private eye Kyo Saeki, a former police detective who's left the force to go into business for himself. The detective is a big fan of video games, and loves spending time at the local arcade (called "Spot 31") practicing his skills in the latest fighting games. He's also got a weakness for life's vices, such as drinking, smoking, gambling, and of course, women.
<br><br>
One day, a young woman visits his office requesting that he take on her case. The crime? A painting belonging to her late father has gone missing, likely stolen by her step-mother. The hero must solve his client's family mystery by gleaning clues through romantic encounters with women in town.

<h2>How to Play</h2>
<ul>
 <li><b>ODE (Optical Drive Emulator)</b><br>The English-patched version of this game is compatible with both the <a href="https://gdemu.wordpress.com/details/docbrown-details/">DocBrown</a> and <a href="https://gdemu.wordpress.com/details/wizard-details/">Wizard</a> ODEs for the FM Towns Marty and the FM Towns, respectively.  Note that only the patched <tt>.bin</tt> file should be copied to the SD card, as neither ODE supports parsing CUE sheets.  Because "Metal & Lace" uses only one data track with no CDDA, both of these ODEs are compatible with the single <tt>.bin</tt>.<br><br>In order to save game progress, an MS-DOS-formatted floppy disk must be present.  For users of FDD emulators (e.g., <a href="https://www.gotekemulator.com/">GoTek</a>, <a href="https://caiusarcade.blogspot.com/2021/05/the-thing-fm-towns-marty-fdd-emulator.html">The Thing</a>), see pre-made disk images below.<br><br>⯈ <a href="https://github.com/DerekPascarella/MetalAndLace-EnglishPatchFMTowns/raw/main/fdd_images/Blank%20Disk%20(MS-DOS%20Formatted).hfe">Blank Disk (MS-DOS Formatted).hfe</a><br>⯈ <a href="https://github.com/DerekPascarella/MetalAndLace-EnglishPatchFMTowns/raw/main/fdd_images/Metal%20%26%20Lace%20-%20Completed%20Save.hfe">Metal & Lace - Completed Save.hfe</a><br><br></li>
 <li><b>Emulator</b><br>The English-patched version of this game is compatible with the <a href="https://github.com/captainys/TOWNSEMU">Tsugaru</a> emulator, and likely <a href="http://townsemu.world.coocan.jp/download.html">Unz</a> as well.  In order to save game progress, an MS-DOS-formatted floppy disk must be present.
