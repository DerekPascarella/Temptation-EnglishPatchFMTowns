<img width="165" height="228" align="right" src="https://github.com/DerekPascarella/Temptation-EnglishPatchFMTowns/blob/main/images/cover_front.jpg?raw=true">English translation patch for the eroge visual novel adventure game "Temptation" on the FM Towns/FM Towns Marty, based on the <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/manga.php?id=8738">original adult manga</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroyuki_Utatane">Hiroyuki Utatane</a>.
<br><br>
Players assume the role of private eye Kyo Saeki, a former police detective who's left the force to go into business for himself. The detective is a big fan of video games, and loves spending time at the local arcade (called "Spot 31") practicing his skills in the latest fighting games. He's also got a weakness for life's vices, such as drinking, smoking, gambling, and of course, women.
<br><br>
One day, a young woman visits his office requesting that he take on her case. The crime? A painting belonging to her late father has gone missing, likely stolen by her step-mother. The hero must solve his client's family mystery by gleaning clues through romantic encounters with women in town.

<h2>How to Play</h2>
<ul>
 <li><b>ODE (Optical Drive Emulator)</b>
  <br>
  The English-patched version of this game is compatible with both the <a href="https://gdemu.wordpress.com/details/docbrown-details/">DocBrown</a> and <a href="https://gdemu.wordpress.com/details/wizard-details/">Wizard</a> ODEs for the FM Towns Marty and the FM Towns, respectively.  Note that only the patched <tt>.bin</tt> file should be copied to the SD card, as neither ODE supports parsing CUE sheets.  Because "Temptation" uses only one data track with no CDDA, both of these ODEs are compatible with the single <tt>.bin</tt>.
  <br><br>
  This game, like many on the FM Towns, requires a user disk to boot the game disc. Note that progress can also be saved to the same disk. For users of FDD emulators (e.g., <a href="https://www.gotekemulator.com/">GoTek</a>, <a href="https://caiusarcade.blogspot.com/2021/05/the-thing-fm-towns-marty-fdd-emulator.html">The Thing</a>), download disk image below.

  <br><br>
 </li>
 <li><b>Emulator</b>
  <br>The English-patched version of this game is compatible with the <a href="https://github.com/captainys/TOWNSEMU">Tsugaru</a> emulator, and likely <a href="http://townsemu.world.coocan.jp/download.html">Unz</a> as well.  This game, like many on the FM Towns, requires a user disk to boot the game disc. Note that progress can also be saved to the same disk. The following disk image has been tested and confirmed working with Tsugaru.

<h2>A Note on Controller Compatibility</h2>
As is not uncommon with the FM Towns/FM Towns Marty, "Temptation" suffers from compatibility problems with certain input peripherals. During the course of developing this translation patch, the following devices were tested on both real hardware and emulator.
<br><br>
<ul>
 <li><b>Keyboard:</b> Compatible</li>
 <li><b>Mouse:</b> Compatible</li>
 <li><b>Controller:</b> Compatible</li>
 <br>
</ul>
Note that any controllers must be left unplugged in order for keyboard or mouse to function properly. Otherwise, players will experience ghost input that makes navigating menus extremely difficult.
